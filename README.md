What is it?
  -----------

  This is the mobile-based app I have built that basically mimics the 
  functionality of Instagram. You can take photos, add photos to your profile,
  and see other users photos. Facebook login is required.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  This was last worked on in November 2014. Refer to contact details 
  for any help trying to reuse this.

 
  Installation
  ------------

  This build is meant for iOS. Basic knowledge of phonegap, Xcode, and 
  Angular/Ionic are required for a successful deploy. Refer to the server
  code as well.
